# Hey, I’m Augusto!

Welcome, I'm glad you made it here!

I’m a tech enthusiast who loves building things that make life easier on daily basis. With 11+ years of experience designing secure, high-performing, and scalable cloud-native solutions, I spend most of my time working with cloud, containers, automation, and infrastructure as code.

I’m all about practical innovation, solutions that actually help teams move faster and with more confidence.

If I have do to it twice, I’m probably already thinking about how to script it.

## What I’m up to
Few years ago, I created/maintain a container called `Mara` (Inspired on Hestio AWSH/Blox). It's an open-source container that bundles a bunch of open source tools to speed up the ops experience on AWS.

One container. Useful the tools. Fewer setup headaches. More things done, faster.

The name was inspired on my Mother `Silvia Mara`, which was battling against depression, that was my way of thinking about her every single day and giving good energy.

Check it out, give it a spin, and let me know what you think. PRs and feedback welcome!
